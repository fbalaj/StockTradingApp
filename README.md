# Stock Trading Simulator App
A GUI app that allows a user to make simulated "paper trades" on S&P 500 companies. The JSoup library is used to scrape the stock data from https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500.

## Sample run:

Suppose the user wants to buy 10 shares of $TSLA stock (Share price $166.2 USD as of 01/30/23)

Then the user's portfolio would look like:

The market value and gain/loss is subject to change based on real-world price movement of $TSLA
